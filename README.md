# Code-Refactor2
# HTML code refactor

## Description
To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. I aimed to make sure that all links are functioning correctly. I also reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
